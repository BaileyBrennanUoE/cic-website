                        Try doing the practical activities of the other parts altogether!<br/>
                        Get the bits of paper from the CPU activityand place them out like descrived in the RAM vs Storage activity. 
                        You can add more family members and linked facts about them! <br/>
                        So for every round you have to do the following:
                            <blockquote>Get a question</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Decide if you need to get the paper from a pile</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Pick the piece out of the bag</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Decide if you need more pieces</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Repeat until you can answer the question!</blockquote>
                        This will give you a good idea of the steps your computer does to do all the things you want it to!
                        </blockquote>
                    </blockquote>
